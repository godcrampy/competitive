# Object Oriented Programming Concepts

1. **Classes**: Classes are like blue-prints. They allow you to make custom data types.
2. **Object**: Every instance of a class is known as an object.
3. **Encapsulation**: All the data and methods of an object live inside the object itself. The the object encapsulates its properties.
4. **Abstraction**: The method definitions of the objects are hidden or abstracted away from the user in the class definition.
5. **Inheritance**: A sub-class can inherit properties and methods of its parent class.
6. **Polymorphism**: In C++, same operators and functions can be overloaded to take different forms.
