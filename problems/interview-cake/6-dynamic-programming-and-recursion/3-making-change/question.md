Your quirky boss collects rare, old coins...

They found out you're a programmer and asked you to solve something they've been wondering for a long time.

Write a function that, given:

1.  an amount of money
2.  a vector of coin denominations

computes the number of ways to make the amount of money with coins of the available denominations.

Example: for amount=4 (4¢) and denominations=[1,2,3] (1¢, 2¢ and 3¢), your program would output 4---the number of ways to make 4¢ with those denominations:

1.  1¢, 1¢, 1¢, 1¢
2.  1¢, 1¢, 2¢
3.  1¢, 3¢
4.  2¢, 2¢
