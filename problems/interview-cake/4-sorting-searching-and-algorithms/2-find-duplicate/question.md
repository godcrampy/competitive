Find a duplicate, *Space Edition*™.

We have a vector of integers, where:

1.  The integers are in the range 1..n1..n
2.  The vector has a length of n+1n+1

It follows that our vector has *at least* one integer which appears *at least* twice. But it may have *several* duplicates, and each duplicate may appear *more than* twice.

Write a function which finds an integer that appears more than once in our vector. (If there are multiple duplicates, you only need to find one of them.)

We're going to run this function on our new, super-hip MacBook Pro With Retina Display™. Thing is, the damn thing came with the RAM soldered right to the motherboard, so we can't upgrade our RAM. So we need to optimize for space!
