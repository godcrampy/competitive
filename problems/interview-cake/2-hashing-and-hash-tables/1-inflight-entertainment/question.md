You've built an inflight entertainment system with on-demand movie streaming.

Users on longer flights like to start a second movie right when their first one ends, but they complain that the plane usually lands before they can see the ending. So you're building a feature for choosing two movies whose total runtimes will equal the exact flight length.

Write a function that takes an integer flightLength (in minutes) and a vector of integers movieLengths (in minutes) and returns a boolean indicating whether there are two numbers in movieLengths whose sum equals flightLength.

When building your function:

- Assume your users will watch *exactly* two movies
- Don't make your users watch the same movie twice
- Optimize for runtime over memory
